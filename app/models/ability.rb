# Implementation class for Cancan gem.  Instead of overriding this class, consider adding new permissions
# using the special +register_ability+ method which allows extensions to add their own abilities.

# See http://github.com/ryanb/cancan for more details on cancan.

  # Allows us to go beyond the standard cancan initialize method which makes it difficult for engines to
  # modify the default +Ability+ of an application.  The +ability+ argument must be a class that includes
  # the +CanCan::Ability+ module.  The registered ability should behave properly as a stand-alone class
  # and therefore should be easy to test in isolation.
