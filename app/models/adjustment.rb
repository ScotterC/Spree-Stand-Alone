# Adjustments represent a change to the +item_total+ of an Order.  Each adjustment has an +amount+ that be either
# positive or negative.  Adjustments have two useful boolean flags
#
# +mandatory+
#
# If this flag is set to true then it means the the charge is required and will not be removed from the
# order, even if the amount is zero.  In other words a record will be created even if the amount is zero.
# This is  useful for representing things such as shipping and tax charges where you may want to make it explicitly
# clear that no charge was made for such things.
#
# +locked+
#
# The charge is never to be udpated.  Typically you would want to freeze certain adjustments after checkout.
# One use case for this is if you want to lock a shipping adjustment so that its value does not change
# in the future when making other trivial edits to the order (like an email change).
